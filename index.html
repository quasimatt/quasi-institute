      <h2>Research Methodology</h2>

      <p>
        Traditional research abandons personal experience in favor of aggregate data, adherence to field-specific models, and strong reliance on literature review. This approach reduces research to the act of <em>“contributing to an existing body of work”</em>, forcing it to adopt established assumptions and limitations. In contrast, our approach roots the genesis of research in the researcher’s direct experience. The task is to generalize and formalize that experience, incorporating external references only when necessary to clarify or extend ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than positioning research as an extension of prior work, we treat it as a process that unfolds in three distinct phases:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Experience</strong> – Direct engagement with an idea as it emerges in real life.</li>
          <li><strong>Generalize</strong> – Identifying the structural mechanics behind that experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Formalize</strong> – Developing a model that explains and extends the phenomenon.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach ensures that research remains organic, conceptually independent, and generative, rather than constrained by pre-existing discourse. We do not prioritize citation loops or institutional validation. Instead, we seek to develop new conceptual tools by engaging deeply with the world, refining ideas through first-principles reasoning, and constructing theories that arise from direct observation and structured thought.
